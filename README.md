# ü¶ç oa

`oa` (short for ["oo oo aa aa"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb8ZAP5JCuk)) is a simple command-line tool for monkey testing frontend applications. 

[Monkey testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_testing) is a technique in which random click, input and keyboard events are sent to an application to test its resilience. In other words, as if a monkey was using it. Monkey testing can also be helpful for adding an increased load to the application to debug performance and memory bottlenecks.

Unlike other load testing tools, `oa` uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) under-the-hood to run your website in a real browser environment. While the browser is hidden by default, you can choose to show it via the `--show` flag.

**Disclaimer: this tool is intended primarily for use on local websites. Attempting to run `oa` on a hosted website, especially one you don't own, is a good way to get your IP blocked.**

## Installation 

Until official binaries can be released, the easiest way to install `oa` is from Deno itself:

```bash
deno install --allow-env --allow-write --allow-read --allow-run --allow-net https://deno.land/x/oa2
```

## Usage

Using `oa` is fairly straightforward. You can test a website using the default options by just passing the URL to the command:

```bash
oa http://127.0.0.1:8080/login
```

## Flags

`oa` supports a few flags to customize its behavior:

| `--time`   | `-t`  | The duration to run the test. Supports human-readable times such as '5m', '1 hour', etc. | 10s     |
| `--header` | `-H`  | HTTP header to pass to the browser. Can be used multiple times.                          |         |
